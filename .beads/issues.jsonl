System continues processing new issues despite declining success rate.\n\n**Reasoning**:\nAnalysis of 5 executions shows a concerning regression pattern:\n\n1. SUCCESS RATE DEGRADATION: Execution 1 (vc-117) succeeded, but the following 3 executions all failed (75% failure rate). The system is now processing a 5th issue (vc-174) without addressing the underlying failure pattern.\n\n2. EXECUTION TIMING: Durations range from 4m56s to 8m23s (mean: 6m42s, std: ~1m20s). Current execution at 16.7s is still early. No clear timing anomaly, but failures are consistent across varying durations.\n\n3. STATE TRANSITION CONSISTENCY: All executions follow identical state transitions (claimed -\u003e assessing -\u003e executing), with 2 transitions each. Current execution shows normal progression (in assessing state). This uniformity despite failures suggests the issue is not in state management but in execution logic.\n\n4. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS: All 5 executions occurred within a 28-minute window (13:24:59 to 13:52:24) with minimal gaps between executions (0-16 seconds). This rapid succession without remediation after failures indicates the system is not learning or adapting.\n\n5. GATES BEHAVIOR: All executions show 'Gates Passed: false', even the successful one. This is unusual - either gates are consistently failing or not being utilized as designed.\n\n6. NO RETRY LOGIC EVIDENT: Each execution processes a different issue (vc-117, 169, 171, 172, 174). There's no evidence of retry mechanisms for failed issues, suggesting failures are being abandoned rather than resolved.\n\nThe pattern suggests a systemic problem introduced after the first successful execution, rather than issue-specific failures.\n\n**Recommended Action**: investigate\n\n---\n**Detection History**:\n- 2025-10-19 13:52:41: Detected (severity=high, confidence=0.88, intervention=pause_agent)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-21T12:17:50.127462-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T22:05:49.156261-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-19T21:07:56.589767-07:00","labels":["affected-issue:vc-174","anomaly:regression","watchdog-escalation"]}

Extract utilities to reduce duplication and centralize \nbehavior. However, not all repetition is bad - simple operations and \ncontext-specific logic can be repeated without harm.'\n\nGuidance (late-2025):\n'Extract when:\n - Pattern appears 3+ times\n - Logic is non-trivial (\u003e5 lines)\n - Behavior should be consistent across uses\n - Pattern has clear semantic meaning\n\n Don't extract:\n - Simple operations (x == nil checks)\n - Context-dependent logic\n - Test boilerplate'\n\nImplementation:\n\n1. Pattern detection strategies:\n   \n   Strategy A: Token-based similarity\n   - Normalize code (remove variable names)\n   - Hash token sequences\n   - Find repeated sequences \u003e10 tokens\n   \n   Strategy B: AI-based (expensive but better)\n   - Feed random file samples to AI\n   - Ask AI to identify repeated patterns\n   - More accurate, catches semantic similarity\n\n2. Build AI prompt (Strategy B):\n   \n   Task: Analyze this codebase for repeated patterns that should \n   be extracted into utilities.\n   \n   Context:\n   - Existing utilities: [list from internal/utils/]\n   - Code samples: [10-20 random file snippets]\n   \n   Look for:\n   - Similar code blocks across files\n   - Operations that agents keep reinventing\n   - Common sequences that lack abstraction\n   \n   Return JSON:\n   {\n     'missing_utilities': [\n       {\n         'pattern': 'String truncation with UTF-8 safety',\n         'occurrences': [\n           'file1.go:45-52',\n           'file2.go:89-96',\n           'file3.go:123-130'\n         ],\n         'suggested_name': 'SafeTruncateString',\n         'suggested_location': 'internal/utils/strings.go',\n         'justification': 'Repeated 3 times, non-trivial logic',\n         'priority': 'P2'\n       }\n     ],\n     'acceptable_repetition': [\n       {\n         'pattern': 'nil check and return',\n         'reason': 'Too simple to warrant utility'\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n\n3.

{"id":"vc-97","title":"Remove redundant code review fallback in quality analysis workflow","description":"After vc-94 implementation, there's a redundant fallback to createCodeReviewIssue when AnalyzeCodeQuality fails (results.go:388-394). This creates inconsistency - we should either always use automated analysis or always fall back, not both.","design":"Decision needed: Should we always use automated quality analysis, or should we have a fallback to manual review? If we keep the fallback, document when/why it's used. If we remove it, ensure AnalyzeCodeQuality error handling is robust.","acceptance_criteria":"1. Decide on fallback strategy and document it\\n2. Either remove the redundant code or clarify its purpose\\n3.

{"id":"vc-98","title":"Add concurrency limits for AI API calls","description":"Multiple AI calls can happen in parallel without limits in the results processor (e.g., code review decision + quality analysis). This can lead to rate limiting and unpredictable costs.","design":"Implement a semaphore or worker pool to limit concurrent AI calls. Consider: max concurrent calls (e.g., 3), queue depth, timeout handling, and priority (e.g., assessment \u003e analysis \u003e summarization).","acceptance_criteria":"1. Add configurable concurrency limit for AI calls\\n2. Implement queuing mechanism with timeout\\n3. Add metrics for queue depth and wait times\\n4.

{"id":"vc-99","title":"Quality gates hang indefinitely during processing","description":"During vc-96 execution, quality gates processing hung for 5+ minutes with no progress. The executor was stuck between 'quality_gates_started' and completion, with watchdog detecting stuck_state but not intervening.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Executor claimed vc-96\n2. Agent completed but didn't implement code\n3. AI analysis completed successfully\n4. Quality gates started at 10:48:29\n5. Hung indefinitely - watchdog detected stuck_state every ~10s for 5+ minutes\n6. Only resolved by killing executor (SIGTERM)\n\nOn shutdown, saw errors:\n- 'warning: No AI supervisor configured for quality gates on vc-96, using fallback logic'\n- 'warning: failed to log gate result: failed to add comment: context canceled'\n- Multiple transaction failures\n\nRoot cause likely in quality gates evaluation logic.","design":"Investigation needed to identify where quality gates hang. Likely candidates:\n1. Gate evaluation loop not terminating\n2. Blocking on AI call that never returns\n3. Database deadlock or long-running query\n4. Missing timeout on gate evaluation\n\nAdd timeout protection (e.g., 2 minutes per gate) and better logging.","acceptance_criteria":"- Quality gates complete or timeout within reasonable time (\u003c 5 min)\n- Add timeout protection per gate evaluation\n- Better logging during gate evaluation\n- Graceful degradation if gates timeout\n- No more indefinite hangs","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-21T12:17:50.127462-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T22:05:49.195276-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T12:05:35.599478-07:00"}
