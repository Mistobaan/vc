The AI supervisor (AnalyzeExecutionResult) reads raw text and tries to infer completion status, discovered issues, blockers, etc.\n\nThe prompt (vc-108) tells agents 'You encounter a technical blocker → You report it and stop' but doesn't provide a structured way to report blockers that the system can reliably parse.\n\nProblems with current approach:\n1.
