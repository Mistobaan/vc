This creates noise and duplicate work.\n\nThis epic implements a deduplication layer that:\n1. Collects discovered issues in sandbox databases during execution\n2. Uses AI to detect semantic duplicates before merging to main database\n3. Prevents duplicate issue creation while preserving cross-references\n4.

System continues processing new issues despite declining success rate.\n\n**Reasoning**:\nAnalysis of 5 executions shows a concerning regression pattern:\n\n1. SUCCESS RATE DEGRADATION: Execution 1 (vc-117) succeeded, but the following 3 executions all failed (75% failure rate). The system is now processing a 5th issue (vc-174) without addressing the underlying failure pattern.\n\n2. EXECUTION TIMING: Durations range from 4m56s to 8m23s (mean: 6m42s, std: ~1m20s). Current execution at 16.7s is still early. No clear timing anomaly, but failures are consistent across varying durations.\n\n3. STATE TRANSITION CONSISTENCY: All executions follow identical state transitions (claimed -\u003e assessing -\u003e executing), with 2 transitions each. Current execution shows normal progression (in assessing state). This uniformity despite failures suggests the issue is not in state management but in execution logic.\n\n4. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS: All 5 executions occurred within a 28-minute window (13:24:59 to 13:52:24) with minimal gaps between executions (0-16 seconds). This rapid succession without remediation after failures indicates the system is not learning or adapting.\n\n5. GATES BEHAVIOR: All executions show 'Gates Passed: false', even the successful one. This is unusual - either gates are consistently failing or not being utilized as designed.\n\n6. NO RETRY LOGIC EVIDENT: Each execution processes a different issue (vc-117, 169, 171, 172, 174). There's no evidence of retry mechanisms for failed issues, suggesting failures are being abandoned rather than resolved.\n\nThe pattern suggests a systemic problem introduced after the first successful execution, rather than issue-specific failures.\n\n**Recommended Action**: investigate\n\n---\n**Detection History**:\n- 2025-10-19 13:52:41: Detected (severity=high, confidence=0.88, intervention=pause_agent)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-19T13:52:41.447646-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-19T23:33:48.240647-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-19T21:07:56.589767-07:00","labels":["affected-issue:vc-174","anomaly:regression","watchdog-escalation"]}
