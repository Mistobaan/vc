# Dogfooding Run #9 - October 18, 2025

## Execution Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Duration**: ~30 minutes (manually interrupted)
**Issues Attempted**: 2 (vc-117, vc-128)
**Issues Completed**: 0
**Issues Blocked**: 1 (vc-117)
**Issues In Progress**: 1 (vc-128 - interrupted)

## Issues Processed

### 1. vc-117: Agent reports success but creates no files in sandboxed environments

**Status**: BLOCKED by quality gates
**Assessment**: confidence=0.75, effort=2-4 hours
**Agent Duration**: 1m49s
**AI Analysis**: completed=false, discovered=3 issues, quality=5 issues

**What Happened**:
- Agent correctly identified that the fix was already implemented in commit 7da3ba1
- Agent performed housekeeping: closed issue in tracker, verified tests pass
- Agent reported status="completed" with verification steps
- **BUT**: AI analysis correctly flagged that acceptance criteria were NOT met
- Acceptance criteria required: "Run vc-106 dogfooding again and verify DOGFOODING.md is created"
- Agent did NOT actually re-run vc-106 to verify the fix works end-to-end

**Quality Gates**:
- Test gate: FAILED (timeout after 5 minutes)
- Issue marked as BLOCKED
- Quality gates context deadline exceeded

**Critical Observation**:
The AI analysis was more accurate than the agent's own assessment. The agent claimed completion, but the analysis correctly identified the work was incomplete and acceptance criteria were not met.

### 2. vc-128: Add graceful shutdown to executor and quality gates

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS (interrupted by manual shutdown)
**Assessment**: confidence=0.78, effort=2-3 hours
**Agent Duration**: ~30 minutes (interrupted)
**Work Completed**: Significant progress, but incomplete

**What Happened**:
- Agent spawned successfully with Claude Code
- Made substantial code changes:
  - Added graceful shutdown to executor.Stop()
  - Added releaseAllClaimedIssues() helper
  - Added deferred cleanup for interrupted execution
  - Added ExecutionStateInterrupted state
  - Created integration tests for graceful shutdown
- Code builds successfully
- **BUT**: Tests fail with nil pointer dereference
- Work was interrupted when we manually killed the executor

**Code Changes Made**:
1. `internal/executor/executor.go`:
   - Graceful shutdown messages
   - releaseAllClaimedIssues() during shutdown
   - Deferred cleanup on context cancellation
   - Checkpoints before each phase
2. `internal/types/types.go`:
   - Added ExecutionStateInterrupted state
3. `internal/executor/integration_test.go`:
   - TestGracefulShutdown (fails with nil pointer)
   - TestGracefulShutdownDuringQualityGates

## Critical Bugs Discovered

### Bug #1: Test Gate Timeout (5 minutes)

**Severity**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Impact**: Blocks all quality gate validation

**Symptoms**:
- Test gate times out after exactly 5 minutes
- "Quality gates cancelled: context deadline exceeded"
- Watchdog detects stuck_state anomalies (severity=medium, confidence=0.65-0.72)
- 10+ watchdog anomaly-detection calls during timeout period

**Evidence**:
```
Running test gate...
AI anomaly-detection call: input=816 tokens, output=371 tokens, duration=10.907618s
Watchdog: No anomalies detected (analyzed 0 executions, duration=10.907677042s)
... [repeats 10+ times]
Watchdog: Anomaly detected - type=stuck_state, severity=medium, confidence=0.72
Completed test gate (passed=false)
Quality gates cancelled: context deadline exceeded
  test: FAIL
```

**Root Cause**: Unknown - test gate appears to hang indefinitely

**Should File**: YES - vc-130

---

### Bug #2: Agent Event Storage Constraint Violation

**Severity**: P1 - HIGH
**Impact**: Agent events not persisted to database

**Symptoms**:
```
warning: failed to store agent event: failed to store agent event: CHECK constraint failed: type IN (
    -- Agent output events
    'file_modified', 'test_run', 'git_operation', 'build_output', 'lint_output', 'progress', 'error', 'watchdog_alert',
    -- Executor-level events
    'issue_claimed', 'assessment_started', 'assessment_completed',
    'agent_spawned', 'agent_completed',
    'results_processing_started', 'results_processing_completed',
    'analysis_started', 'analysis_completed',
    'quality_gates_started', 'quality_gates_completed', 'quality_gates_skipped'
)
```

**Root Cause**: Agent attempting to store an event type not in the CHECK constraint whitelist

**Should File**: YES - vc-131

---

### Bug #3: UNIQUE Constraint Failed When Creating Discovered Issues

**Severity**: P1 - HIGH
**Impact**: Discovered issues from AI analysis not persisted

**Symptoms**:
```
watchdog: error checking for anomalies: intervention failed: failed to create escalation issue: failed to insert issue: UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id
Warning: failed to handle gate results: failed to create AI-recommended issue: failed to insert issue: UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id
```

**Root Cause**: Issue ID collision when creating discovered issues

**Should File**: YES - vc-132

---

### Bug #4: Invalid State Transition (executing â†’ interrupted)

**Severity**: P2 - MEDIUM
**Impact**: Graceful shutdown cannot mark issues as interrupted

**Symptoms**:
```
warning: failed to mark test-3667508066-1 as interrupted: invalid state transition from executing to interrupted
```

**Root Cause**: ExecutionStateInterrupted not recognized as valid state (code change not in effect during run, or state machine validation rejects it)

**Should File**: YES - part of vc-128 (agent was working on this)

---

### Bug #5: Nil Pointer Dereference in TestGracefulShutdown

**Severity**: P2 - MEDIUM
**Impact**: Test coverage for graceful shutdown broken

**Symptoms**:
```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x2 addr=0x20 pc=0x1010fb344]
at integration_test.go:1027
```

**Root Cause**: Test code has nil pointer bug (likely gate runner or provider)

**Should File**: YES - part of vc-128 (agent wrote this test)

## Positive Observations

### AI Analysis Quality

The AI analysis for vc-117 was **more accurate** than the agent's self-assessment:
- Agent: "status: completed"
- AI Analysis: "completed=false" - correctly identified missing acceptance criteria
- AI correctly noted that agent did NOT re-run vc-106 to verify fix

This demonstrates the value of AI supervision - the analysis layer caught what the agent missed.

### Watchdog Anomaly Detection

Watchdog correctly detected stuck state during test gate timeout:
- 10+ anomaly checks during 5-minute hang
- Detected stuck_state with medium severity
- confidence scores: 0.65-0.72 (below 0.75 intervention threshold)
- Intervened when confidence hit 0.72

### Code Quality (vc-128)

Despite incomplete execution, the agent produced high-quality code:
- Comprehensive graceful shutdown implementation
- Proper context propagation
- Deferred cleanup handlers
- Integration test coverage (though buggy)
- Builds successfully

## System Metrics

**AI Calls**:
- Assessment: 2 calls (vc-117, vc-128)
- Analysis: 1 call (vc-117 only)
- Anomaly Detection: 20+ calls (watchdog monitoring)
- Recovery Strategy: 1 call (vc-117)

**Quality Gates**:
- Test gate: 1 run, 1 timeout (100% failure rate)

**Executor**:
- Runtime: ~30 minutes
- Issues claimed: 2
- Issues completed: 0
- Issues blocked: 1
- Issues interrupted: 1

## Issues to File

1. **vc-130**: Test gate hangs indefinitely (timeout after 5 minutes)
   - Priority: P0
   - Type: bug
   - Blocks: All quality gate validation

2. **vc-131**: Agent event storage CHECK constraint violation
   - Priority: P1
   - Type: bug
   - Blocks: Event persistence

3. **vc-132**: UNIQUE constraint failed when creating discovered issues
   - Priority: P1
   - Type: bug
   - Blocks: AI-discovered issue creation

## Recommendations

1. **Fix test gate timeout (vc-130)** - This is a critical blocker preventing any work from passing quality gates

2. **Complete vc-128 manually** - Agent made good progress, but needs:
   - Fix nil pointer in test
   - Fix state transition validation
   - Verify graceful shutdown works end-to-end

3. **Revisit vc-117** - Once test gate is fixed:
   - Unblock the issue
   - Re-run to verify end-to-end (run vc-106 dogfooding)

4. **Investigate watchdog threshold** - Consider lowering intervention threshold from 0.75 to 0.70 to catch stuck states earlier

## Comparison to Previous Runs

**Run #8**:
- Issues attempted: Multiple
- Issues completed: Several
- Major findings: 3 bugs filed

**Run #9**:
- Issues attempted: 2
- Issues completed: 0
- Major findings: 4 critical bugs
- **Regression**: Quality gates completely broken (test gate timeout)

## Conclusion

Dogfooding run #9 revealed **critical quality gate regression** - the test gate now hangs indefinitely, blocking all work. This is a P0 blocker that must be fixed before any further dogfooding runs.

However, the run also demonstrated:
- AI analysis catches agent blind spots (vc-117)
- Watchdog correctly detects anomalies
- Agents can produce quality code even when interrupted (vc-128)

**Next Steps**:
1. File discovered issues (vc-130, vc-131, vc-132)
2. Fix test gate timeout (vc-130) - TOP PRIORITY
3. Resume vc-128 work after test gate fixed
